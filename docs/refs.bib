 abstract={spatstat is a package for analyzing spatial point pattern data. Its functionality includes exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, and simulation. It is designed to handle realistic datasets, including inhomogeneous point patterns, spatial sampling regions of arbitrary shape, extra covariate data, and &amp;quot;marks&amp;quot; attached to the points of the point pattern. A unique feature of spatstat is its generic algorithm for fitting point process models to point pattern data. The interface to this algorithm is a function ppm that is strongly analogous to lm and glm. This paper is a general description of spatstat and an introduction for new users.},
